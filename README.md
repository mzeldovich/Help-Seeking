# Help-seeking and help-receiving  behavior in the Austrian general population and the impact of self-stigma

## Summary
The aim of this study was to examine help-seeking and help-receiving behavior in the Austrian general population, investigate associations with psychological distress and symptom burden, and explore the moderating role of self-stigma. A representative sample (stratified by age, gender, education level, province of residence, and their intersections) of Austrian residents included data from N = 2,205 participants collected through an online survey.
We assessed help-seeking behavior using the [General Help-Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-05989-002) and self-stigma using the [Self-Stigma of Seeking Help Scale (SSOSH)](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0167.53.3.325). Symptom burden was assessed with validated German versions of the self-report questionnaires screening for [depression (PHQ-9)](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1525-1497.2001.016009606.x), [anxiety (GAD-7)](https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.166.10.1092), [insomnia (ISI-7)](https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/34.5.601), [perceived stress (PSS-4)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-98838-002), [loneliness (SOEP)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279701), and [alcohol misuse (CAGE)](https://doi.org/10.25011/cim.v30i1.447).
