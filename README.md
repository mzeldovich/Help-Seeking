# Help-seeking and help-receiving  behavior in the Austrian general population and the impact of self-stigma

## Summary
The aim of this study was to examine help-seeking and help-receiving behavior in the Austrian general population, investigate associations with psychological distress and symptom burden, and explore the moderating role of self-stigma. A representative sample (stratified by age, gender, education level, province of residence, and their intersections) of Austrian residents included data from N = 2,205 participants collected through an online survey.
We assessed help-seeking behavior using the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ) and self-stigma using the Self-Stigma of Seeking Help Scale (SSOSH). Symptom burden was assessed with validated German versions of the self-report questionnaires screening for depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), insomnia (ISI-7), perceived stress (PSS-4), loneliness (SOEP), and alcoholism (CAGE).
